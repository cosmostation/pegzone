  Peg-Zone Prototype
</h1>

[Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io) has been actively researching various decentralized bitcoin sidechain models and is working on building an innovative, decentralized, secure Peg Zone within [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network/). We presented a Peg-Zone prototype and shared our insights at the Cosmos Meetup in Seoul. 
In the PDF file below, you can check the result of every `txid` and `address` on the Bitcoin Testnet Explorer.
 Note that this prototype only demonstrates basic operations of the `Reserve Wallet` and the `Relayer` which are key components in depositing and withdrawing funds from the sidechain.

## Bridging Non-Tendermint Chains

Cross-blockchain crypto-asset transfer between Cosmos Hub and non-Tendermint chains that have different settlement finality require a bridge called `Peg Zone`. 
The link below will give you an in-depth explanation of a Peg Zone.

## Reserve Wallet

Based on the design of [Nomic](https://github.com/nomic-io/bitcoin-peg/blob/master/bitcoinPeg.md), you can see the `Reserve Wallet`, which is the wallet that actual Bitcoin is stored and managed in. The ownership of the `Reserve Wallet` is split into a number of validators who secure the network by using [multisignature](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) technology. As you can see in the image, each `Reserve Wallet` consists of various validators, such as A, B, C, and etc. Each validator has a specific amount of voting power(stake) in the network. `Reserve Wallet A` is created first and `Reserve Wallet E` is the most recent wallet.

The voting power changes as follows: `A is -30`, `C is +20`, and `E is +10` from the previous validator set of the network. If there is any change of voting power within the network, there will be an event called `checkpoint`. When a checkpoint occurs, it will create a new `Reserve Wallet`, and transfers all BTC amount from the previous wallet to the new wallet managed by a new set of validators reorganized by current voting power.

There will also be a `checkpoint` when there is a new validator in the validator set or any existing validator falls out of the validator set due to different reasons. In this case, Peg Zone creates a new `Reserve Wallet D` and move all BTC from `Reserve Wallet C ` to `Reserve Wallet D`.

Let's say a user deposits BTC in `Reserve Wallet A`, `0.05 CBTC` is minted as soon as the deposit is verified. The user can withdraw this `0.05 CBTC` to the Bitcoin Network at any time through the Peg-Zone.

## Conclusion

We are actively conducting research on how we can build an innovative, decentralized, secure, user-friendly Peg Zone connecting to the Cosmos Hub. In the meantime, we are also analyzing various sidechain mechanisms used in `Nomic`, `tBTC`, `Liquid`, etc.
